# Feature Engineering Project

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of projects focused on feature engineering and data analysis for machine learning applications. The main objective is to transform raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance. The project includes Jupyter Notebook files and related resources detailing various techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.

## Contents
- **Feature_Engineering_Dataset.ipynb:** A notebook demonstrating data cleaning, feature transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Additional files and notebooks related to clustering, predictive modeling, and other machine learning experiments.

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset, identify important features, and visualize data relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Apply techniques to convert raw data into valuable input for machine learning models.
- **Insight Generation:** Derive actionable insights to guide model improvements and decision-making.
